If an attacker gains initial access to a system, they will attempt to escalate
privileges to maintain persistence and expand control.

Data Sources
- Linux authentication logs
- Sudo command logs
- Windows Security Event logs

Hunt Methodology
- Review authentication failures
- Analyze privilege escalation attempts
- Correlate activity across hosts
